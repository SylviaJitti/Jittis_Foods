# How to run and Use
<ol>
<li>Open your Flask project in VS Code: Launch VS Code and open the folder or directory containing your Flask project.</li>
<li>Set up a virtual environment (optional): It's recommended to create a virtual environment for your Flask project to isolate its dependencies. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by going to `View â†’ Terminal` or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+` backtick `(`Ctrl+`` `)`. In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment using the following command:
   python -m venv venv</li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment with the appropriate command based on your operating system
   - On Windows:
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
   - On macOS/Linux:
     source venv/bin/activate</li>
<li>Install project dependencies: With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary dependencies for your Flask project. Typically, these dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file. In the terminal, run the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   This command will install all the required packages.</li>
<li>Set the Flask app environment variable: If your Flask app file is named `app.py`, open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run the following command to set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:
   - On Windows (Command Prompt): 
     set FLASK_APP=app.py
   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
   - On macOS/Linux:
     export FLASK_APP=app.py
   Replace `app.py` with the actual filename of your Flask app file if it's different.</li>
<li>Run the Flask server: In the terminal, run the following command to start the Flask server:
   flask run
   The Flask server will start running, and you should see output or log messages indicating that the server is running. By default, the server will bind to `localhost` on port `5000`.</li>
<li>Access your Flask app in the browser: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with your Flask application.
That's it! You have successfully run your Flask project in VS Code. You can make changes to your Flask app code, and the server will automatically reload with the updated changes.
Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured correctly in your Flask project. If you encounter any errors or issues, double-check your project setup and consult the Flask documentation for troubleshooting tips.</>
